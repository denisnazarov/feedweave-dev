# feedweave-dev

[FEEDweave](https://feedweave.co) is a community-built social network running on top of the [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) blockchain.

This repo is for community discussion of improvement proposals to the FEEDweave application and the underlying infrastructure.

The FEEDweave development process is modeled after Ethereum's [EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/) process.

Main discussion happens in the [Issues](https://github.com/denisnazarov/feedweave-dev/issues) section of this repo. Accepted EIPs are commited to the repo as markdown files.
